The pursuit of the perfect basketball shot relies heavily on practice and patience, with those capable of consistently accurate throws being paid millions of dollars as professional athletes. The overdetermined nature of tendon excursions for this neuromechanical system predisposes itself to an infinite number of trajectories, each exhibiting unique muscle contraction velocity profiles. Larger contraction velocities may lead to endpoint inaccuracies as increased neural control increases neural noise, increased speed decreases accuracy by Fitt's law, and increase eccentric contractions necessitates precise alpha-gamma coactivation to allow fluid motion. As such, we modeled a planar upper limb with three degrees of freedom and 18 muscles to explore what effect subtle changes in endpoint space had on the muscle contraction velocity profiles. By generating 10,000 physiologically feasible trajectories for each of the three joint angles we could observe the resulting endpoint trajectories through the forward kinematic model and we were able to approximate the tendon excursions by posture dependent muscle moment arms. In cataloguing the maximal muscle contraction velocities (both eccentrically and concentrically) for each trajectory we noted while this metric lends itself to a large distribution of shot types there exists shot selections that will generate similar endpoint trajectories. More specifically, we found that in exploring the space of possible endpoint trajectories it is possible to choose strategies that could appear similar kinematically while exhibiting suprisingly different muscle contraction velocities. This computational approach could help reconcile the difference between a "good looking" shot and a "good" shot when viewed in conjunction with the adverse effects of speed/accuracy trade offs.
